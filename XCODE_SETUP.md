# Xcode Project Setup Instructions

## Creating the iOS App in Xcode

Since we can't generate Xcode project files directly, follow these steps to create the iOS app:

### Step 1: Create New Xcode Project
1. Open Xcode
2. Choose "Create a new Xcode project"
3. Select **iOS > App**
4. Fill in project details:
   - Product Name: `SwiftVisualPoetry`
   - Bundle Identifier: `com.yourname.swiftvisualpoetry`
   - Language: **Swift**
   - Interface: **SwiftUI**
   - Use Core Data: **No** (we'll use local storage)

### Step 2: Replace Generated Files
1. Delete the generated `ContentView.swift` and `SwiftVisualPoetryApp.swift`
2. Copy all files from the `SwiftVisualPoetry/` folder into your Xcode project
3. Add the files to your Xcode project target

### Step 3: Project Structure
Your Xcode project should have this structure:
```
SwiftVisualPoetry/
├── SwiftVisualPoetryApp.swift      (Main app entry point)
├── Views/
│   ├── ContentView.swift           (Tab navigation)
│   ├── CameraView.swift           (Camera tab)
│   ├── GalleryView.swift          (Gallery picker tab)
│   └── PersonalGalleryView.swift  (Personal gallery tab)
├── Models/                        (Data models - coming soon)
├── ViewModels/                    (Business logic - coming soon)
└── Utils/                         (Helper functions - coming soon)
```

### Step 4: Test the App
1. Select a simulator or device
2. Build and run (⌘+R)
3. You should see a tab-based app with Camera, Gallery, and My Photos tabs

## Next Steps
Once the basic app is running, we'll implement:
- Camera capture functionality
- Photo gallery picker
- Photo editing canvas
- Text overlay system with gestures
